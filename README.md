# Professional-README-Generator

## Description
Hello my name is Matthew Kim and I am a beginner programmer studying at the UCI coding Bootcamp. This readme generator was created to help lazy programming students create a professional
'README.md' for their projects. The program will take different inputs from the user and generate a new README file in the 'final' folder; 
Here is a video showing the functionality of the program:

Here is a screenshot of a generated README:

Thank you for taking the time to use and view my program

## Installation 
To install necessary dependencies use the command: 'npm i' in the terminal
Then run 'node index.js' to start the program.

## Usage
After starting the program - it will go on to ask you questions needed to generate a README file for your project. All you need to do is answer the questions to the best of your abilities and be as descriptive as possible.
